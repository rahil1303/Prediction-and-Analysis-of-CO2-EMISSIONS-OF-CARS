# Prediction and Analysis of CO2 Emissions of Cars

This project involves the development of a Python-based machine learning model to predict future CO2 emissions of cars. The model uses various techniques including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multiple Linear Regression, and Classification methods to analyze and predict emissions based on fuel consumption data.

## Project Structure

- **CO2 emissions.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predicting CO2 emissions.
- **FuelConsumptionCo2.csv**: Dataset used in the project, containing information on fuel consumption and corresponding CO2 emissions.
- **Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of Multiple Linear Regression for predicting CO2 emissions.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: The project begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv` dataset to understand the key factors influencing CO2 emissions.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implementation of the KNN algorithm to predict CO2 emissions based on the closest data points in the dataset.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: A model that predicts CO2 emissions based on multiple independent variables such as engine size, fuel consumption, and more.
- **Classification**: An approach to classify cars based on their CO2 emissions into different categories (e.g., low, medium, high).
